# Student Management System with DTOs

A **Spring Boot** project for managing student records efficiently using **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** to ensure **secure, flexible, and high-performance API communication**.  
This system follows modern Java backend best practices and demonstrates how to build scalable RESTful APIs while separating database entities from API contracts.

## Project Motivation

Managing student data manually or through legacy systems is error-prone, insecure, and inefficient.  
This project was developed to:

- Demonstrate **secure API design** using DTOs  
- Follow **Spring Boot best practices**  
- Provide a **flexible and maintainable codebase**  
- Illustrate **decoupling of database entities and API contracts**  

By implementing DTOs, validation, and structured layers, this system ensures that developers can safely expose APIs without risking sensitive data leakage.

## Project Overview

The **Student Management System** allows users to perform CRUD operations on student records.  
It uses **DTOs** to separate API requests/responses from database entities.  
Key aspects of the project include:

- **DTO-based API communication**  
- **Secure handling of sensitive fields** (passwords, internal IDs)  
- **Validation per request**  
- **Performance optimization** (only send necessary data)  
- **MySQL persistence**  

---

## Features

- Add, view, update, delete student records  
- Separate DTOs for **creation, response, and update**  
- Securely exclude sensitive fields in API responses  
- Request-specific validations (e.g., password required only on creation)  
- Layered architecture for maintainability  
- RESTful APIs for easy frontend integration  
- MySQL database for persistent storage  
- Easy scalability for future features

## Architecture

The project follows a **layered architecture** for scalability and maintainability:

1. **Controller Layer**  
   - Handles HTTP requests  
   - Maps requests to DTOs  
   - Returns API responses via DTOs  

2. **Service Layer**  
   - Contains business logic  
   - Handles validation, security checks, and DTO mapping  

3. **Repository Layer**  
   - Interacts with the database using Spring Data JPA  
   - Queries and persists entities  

4. **DTO Layer**  
   - Contains **StudentCreateDTO**, **StudentResponseDTO**, and **StudentUpdateDTO**  
   - Ensures proper field exposure, validation, and flexibility  

5. **Entity Layer**  
   - Represents the database table for students  
   - Mapped using JPA annotations

## Why DTOs?

DTOs are used for:

1. **Security**  
   - Prevent exposing sensitive fields like passwords and internal IDs  
2. **Flexibility**  
   - API can evolve independently from the database schema  
3. **Validation**  
   - Apply request-specific validations  
4. **Decoupling**  
   - Entities are tied to the DB, DTOs are tied to the API contract  
5. **Performance**  
   - Only required data is sent, reducing payload size

## Entity vs DTO Mapping

**Example:**

```java
// Entity
@Entity
public class Student {
    private Long id;
    private String fullName;
    private String email;
    private String password;  // sensitive
}

// Create DTO
public class StudentCreateDTO {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String password;
}

// Response DTO
public class StudentResponseDTO {
    private String name;
    private String email;  // password excluded
}
